The location is perfect for those looking to enjoy the vibrancy of the city yet at the same offers the enjoyment of nature for those who wish to escape from the city life. In addition, all the tower blocks in Parc Clematis are tilted in north-south facing orientation to avoid direct west sunrays. It was purposely built with space between tower blocks to create distance for better privacy between all the units. With this design, more greeneries are planted at the base of the blocks to give a see-through vantage views towards landscape area while allowing more sunlight and airflow through the neighbourhood. Moreover, Parc Clematis also offer a wide variety of facilities for its residents such as 50-meter pool, reflexology garden, aquatherapy / hydrotherapy pool, indoor gymnasium, multipurpose court and many more.",
