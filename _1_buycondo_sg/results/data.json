District 5 Is also particularly car-friendly. Residents with cars are well served by the Ayer Rajah Expressway and the West Coast Highway.\nWith a land area of 25,500ha, the West Region is the largest of the five regions in Singapore. Jurong East is the regional centre of the region, while Jurong West is the most populous town in the region. Many of Singapore\u2019s heavy industry companies are concentrated in the West Region. These are mainly petrochemical companies comprising international players such as BP, ExxonMobil, DuPont, Mitsui Chemicals and Shell. The West Region is also at the forefront of the government\u2019s industrial development efforts. The government plans to develop the Jurong Lake District and Jurong Innovation District into Singapore\u2019s second Central Business District (CBD) area.

The eligibility criteria for ECs are set by the government and are subject to change. On the other hand, there are no restrictions on who can purchase a condo, and foreign nationals are also eligible to buy a condo in Singapore.Price: ECs are generally priced lower than condos due to their eligibility criteria and government restrictions. This makes ECs more affordable for many Singaporeans looking to own a home.Amenities: ECs have amenities similar to those found in private condos, including swimming pools, gymnasiums, and clubhouse facilities. However, the amenities in ECs are typically smaller and not as extensive as those in private condos.Resale Restrictions: ECs have resale restrictions for the first five years after the government issuance of the Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP). During this time, EC unit owners are only allowed to sell their units to Singaporeans or Permanent Residents (PRs).After the five-year minimum occupancy period (MOP), EC unit owners may sell their units to all eligible buyers, including foreign nationals, subject to conditions set by the government. There are no such restrictions on the resale of condos.Maintenance Fees: ECs must set aside a certain amount of funds for their maintenance and upgrading this is the same as condo owners.Location: ECs are usually located in the suburbs, away from the central business district, whereas condos are more likely to be found in central areas, near the city centre.Design and Layout: ECs are usually built with standard designs and layouts, whereas condos offer more customization options, including different unit types and layouts.\nIn conclusion, ECs and condos offer different advantages and disadvantages. While ECs (New Launch or 5 MOP Turn Privatised) are more affordable and cater to the housing needs of Singaporeans, condos offer more freedom, amenities, and customization options.\nUltimately, choosing between an EC and a condo will depend on individual circumstances, such as income, family size, and personal preferences.\n",
